Partner 1 and partner 2 both editted the datapth together. Partner 1 created the pathing for the finite state machine and partner 2 helped fix outputs. Partner 1 and 2 created the cpu.v file together with partner 2 doing most of the typing. Partner 2 figured out how to implement the 2's complement adding and subtracting and output flag signals (~75 lines of code). Partner 1 wrote the first stage of the testbench for the finite state machine and cpu (~150) and partner 2 updated the datapath testbench to make sure everything was still working(~50 lines). Partner 1 found that the register file enable signals were missing being ANDed to the write input which was causing the registers to be overwritten with garbage values.
